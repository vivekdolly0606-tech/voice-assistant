# Project Description

This is a Python-based Voice Assistant project. The assistant is capable of recognizing voice commands and performing tasks such as opening websites, responding with voice output, and handling basic user interactions. The project was built to understand core concepts of speech recognition, text-to-speech, conditional logic, and automation using Python.

This project brings Python to life through an interactive voice-controlled assistant.
Designed and completed as a hands-on learning project to explore real-world automation.
Transforms spoken commands into meaningful actions with instant voice feedback.
Showcases the power of Python in building smart, user-friendly applications.
Built with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and beginner accessibility.
Demonstrates practical implementation of speech recognition and text-to-speech.
Represents a complete and functional mini AI assistant project.
Lays a strong foundation for future AI, ML, and automation-based enhancements.
A project that combines creativity with core programming logic.
Completed successfully and refined through testing and iteration.
